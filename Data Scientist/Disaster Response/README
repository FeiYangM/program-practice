This project is designed for sending warnings about disaster based on analyzing the text on social media.
The Python program includes two parts. One is pre-processing data and outputting them into a SQL database.
The other one is loading data from database and training a Machine Learning model to respond to the data.

Usage:
    1.  run: python process_data.py disaster_message.csv disaster_categories.csv DisasterResponse.db
    2.  run: python train_classifier.py  DisasterResponse.db classifier.pkl

Data is not provided here.

Example of them:

disaster_message.csv:
   id,message,original,genre
   xxx,xxx,xxx,xxx
   ......
   xxx,xxx,xxx,xxx
   
   (column message is sentences that should be analyzed)
   
disaster_categories.csv:
   id,categories
   xxx,xxx
   ......
   xxx,xxx
   (column categories include many classes. The data is like related-1,medical-0,...,food-0.
   One column includes a lot of information that need pre-process steps before training model)
