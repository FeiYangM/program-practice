A mini-project for A/B test analysis.
Imagine you need to test a new design of your website to sell something.
The data you collected includes two things:
1. ab_test.csv, it looks like:

   user_id,timestamp,group,landing_page,converted
   1,2020-1-10,control,old_page,0
   2,2020-1-11,control,old_page,1
   3,2020-1-12,treatment,new_page,1
   ......
   
2. country_info.csv:

   user_id,country
   1,UK
   2,US
   ......
   
Above shows what the data looks like, but they are not provided here.

The program ab_test.py outputs the result telling you whether the new design 
improves conversion rate based on the data with hypothesis test methods and
logistic regression model, seperately.
