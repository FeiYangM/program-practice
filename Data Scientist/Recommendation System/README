This is a simple recommendation system. The original data is not provided here, but it looks like:

data.csv:

article_id,title,email
XXX,XXX,XXX
......
XXX,XXX,XXX


Tips: This input file includes three columns which are article_id, title and email. It is like a platform
where users log in and read articles. So the data is about whom the users are and what articles they read.
Article_id is a number for each article, and the title stands for the specific title of the article.

The Python program in this folder aims to recommend new articles for users based on two methods,
Rank-Based Recommendation and User-User Based Recommendation. More methods will be added soon.
